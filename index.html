        <div class="project">
            <h3>The Language of Trauma and Hope: A Visual Analysis of Wonder Egg Priority</h3>
            <p>This project is a deep-dive analysis of how the anime <em>Wonder Egg Priority</em> uses its animation as a fundamental storytelling tool to translate complex psychological themes into a visceral visual experience.</p>
            
            <div class="analysis-points">
                <h4>Key Analysis Points:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Color & Mood:</strong> Deconstructed how the cool, purple-and-blue palette of the dream world creates a sense of beautiful isolation, contrasting with the desaturated tones of reality to highlight emotional pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera & Perspective:</strong> Analyzed how low-angle shots make the world feel imposing and how Dutch angles during monster encounters create disorientation and terror.</li>
                    <li><strong>Animation & Emotion:</strong> Broke down how character movements shift from fluid to jerky and distorted to manifest abstract concepts like trauma and fear physically.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This analysis taught me that true storytelling is holistic. The "editing" and "visuals" are not separate from the script; they <em>are</em> the script. Every frame is an intentional choice that guides the audience's emotion.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science student at New Generation University College who believes that technology is at its best when it tells a compelling story. While I enjoy deep, analytical work and am a keen listener, my passion lies in understanding and deconstructing visual narratives.</p>
        <p>My strength is in my ability to analyze details—whether it's a line of code or a sequence of animation—to understand the deeper structure and meaning. I am actively seeking opportunities to learn the technical skills of video editing and animation to complement my analytical mind and creative spirit.</p>
